This is very much beta, it seems to work fine but its not optimized and doesn't currently suport the interrupt capability of the chip

Currently it can do: setting pin directions, inputs and outputs and turning on/off the pull-up resistors

To use:
Connect pin #1 of the expander to D1 (i2c clock)
Connect pin #1 to 5V (using a pullup resistor ~4K7 (4700) ohms)
Connect pin #2 of the expander to D0 (i2c data)
Connect pin #2 to 5V (using a pullup resistor ~4K7 (4700) ohms)
Connect pins #3, 4 and 5 of the expander to ground (address selection)
Connect pin #6 and 18 of the expander to 5V (power and reset disable)
Connect pin #9 of the expander to ground (common ground)
Pins 10 thru 17 are your input/output pins
